# Cryptex

The entire project consists of two parts: [frontend](https://github.com/ECE4410J-Pentagram/Pentagram-Frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/ECE4410J-Pentagram/Pentagram-Backend).

## Individual Contribution

### Baichun Li
Contributed part of the frontend system (including the key management part). Worked on the entire backend system, designed the Postgres SQL table structure and designed the entire API structure.

### Che Chen

### Pingbang Hu

Researched the *text2image Steganography algorithm*. Design the pseudo-randomized LSB (Least Significant Bit) Embedding algorithm with the private key. Proving the algorithm is secure at the theoretical level (i.e., based on common cryptography premises). Characterize the image distortion under the proposed algorithm.
